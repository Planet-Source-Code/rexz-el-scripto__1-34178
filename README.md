### Description

This is another tweak of the somewhat popular scripting language JEL here on PSC =) I don't take any credit for the scripting class, but all of the other i've made myself! :) (I might add that it's not finished yet! There's alot more to do) Also, i've added some small network and keyboard input features and there's more to come.
 
### More Info
 
Don't make .exe files right now.. they don't end up to good; you can run them, but they restart when they should end.
